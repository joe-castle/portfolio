- properlly redseign site
- redesign projects page to make it look less codepeny
- move all front-end projects to github pages and make them standalone (remove use of typographic everywhere mixin), include these links on freecodecamp
- remove timrjs on site and keep readme in github
- comments everywhere
- remove redux, not overly needed, maybe even react? Probably a bit overkill for a static page. Note: as projects will be standalone, react isn't needed.
 - Look into jekyll template devtips uses?
- host the site on github pages, heroku is slow to load and unecassary
